# WarehouseMgmt
This project was done for a self-storage facility that needed a way to store and manage tenant/payment information as well as information about the storage units. 

To implement it, I used MySQL and Java Database Connectivity. The client also requested that the program be able to send receipts and payment reports to tenants, so I used JavaMail.
